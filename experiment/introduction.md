## Introduction 

Information Systems (IS) help in managing and updating the vast business-related information. Before designing such an IS, it is helpful to identify the various stakeholders, and the information that they would be exchanging with the system. An IS, however, is a large software comprised of several modules, which, in turn, share the process the available data. These data are often stored in databases for further references. A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is used to pictorially represent the functionalities of the ISs by focusing on the sources and destinations of the data flowing in the system.
